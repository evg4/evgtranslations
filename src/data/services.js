    title: "Localisation",
    text: "I think of localisation as a mixture between translation and proofreading: in my case, I work with texts that are written in US English, or any other English variant, and update them to make them suitable for a British English audience. This includes the obvious things like spelling, but can consist of cultural changes too where relevant.",
