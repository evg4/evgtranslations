## Title
EVG Translations
## Description 
I built this website for my translation business. It is built with React and uses React Routing for navigation. The primary purpose is a landing page for my business to inform clients of my services; there is no interactivity. In the future, it would be nice to add a "contact me" functionality with a contact form that sends any messages directly to my email address. The website is fully responsive and can be viewed on a desktop or mobile device; this proved the most challenging part as there were a lot of breakpoints. I already had the domain name as I had previously created a website with Squarespace and purchased the domain through them, so I updated the settings to point it to this website instead.  
## How to use
This can be viewed at https://evgtranslations.com/ (until Jan 2025 when the domain expires) and then at https://evg-translations.netlify.app/.
## Credits
I learnt all my coding skills from Codecademy's Front-End Engineering path.
Squarespace help pages provided info on pointing the domain.
